# Efficient Attention in Vision Transformers

See [proposal.md](./proposal.md) for project proposal, and [plan.md](./plan.md) for implementation plan.

## Setup

We can import this repo into Google Colab (via Github) and run it from there using our credits, or use our virtual machine on GCP.

OR

We can set up a conda environment in the repository:

```bash
cd path/to/project                                    # Go to your project directory

# Create environment inside the project folder and add dependencies in yml file
conda create --prefix ./env --file environment.yml

conda activate ./env                                  # Activate the environment
conda install <package_name>                          # Install additional packages

# if you install any new depencies, make sure to update the environment.yml file
conda env export --from-history --file environment.yml

# when you're finished
conda deactivate
```

## Contributing

There's 3 folders you should create your local repo (all gitignored):

1. `data/` (gitignored): the folder that will contain our dataset
2. `logs/`: The folder used for the logs generated by Tensorboard
3. `models/`: the folder that will save the `.pt` files for any model weights we save after training.

We can un-gitignore models/ and data/ this if we want to share weights and logs for graphing.

`ipynb` notebooks and `py` files can live at the root level of the repository. If it gets too cluttered, we can move them into `src` and `notebooks` folders (not created yet).
